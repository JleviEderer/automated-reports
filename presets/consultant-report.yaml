name: "Consultant Report"
description: "Analytical, editorial-quality reports for professional audiences"

content:
  tone: |
    Analytical, authoritative, third-person. Write as if you are a senior
    consultant presenting findings to a client's leadership team.
  structure: |
    Write prose for the sections the source provides. If you consolidate
    scattered information into a new section that doesn't exist in the source
    material, mark it in the YAML frontmatter:
    suggested_additions: ['Production Considerations']
    The Design Agent renders suggested additions normally. The QA Agent flags
    them for human review but does not auto-fail them.
  frontmatter_note: |
    The colors and typography fields in YAML frontmatter describe the SOURCE
    MATERIAL's visual properties (e.g., the billboard's palette). These are
    reference data for the report's content. They are NOT instructions for
    the report's own design. The Design Agent chooses the report's accent
    color independently per its style constraints.

design:
  aesthetic: "McKinsey meets Monocle magazine — editorial, restrained, authoritative"
  accent_color: |
    One muted accent color, chosen from: burgundy, muted teal, forest green,
    or slate blue. Use sparingly. NEVER use the subject's own brand colors
    (from the content frontmatter) as the report's accent. The report is an
    independent analytical document, not a brand extension.
  fonts:
    body: "Serif — Libre Baskerville, EB Garamond, Georgia, Garamond, Crimson Text"
    headings: "Clean sans-serif — DM Sans, Source Sans 3, Outfit"
  body_size: "10-11pt"
  cover: "Title, subtitle/date, client name. Minimal. No images, no decorative borders."
  columns: "Single column for narrative. Two columns only for data appendices."

qa:
  body_size_range: "10-11pt"
  max_colors: 3
  screenshot_test: |
    If someone saw a screenshot of any page, they would think a boutique
    consulting firm made it — not an AI, not a SaaS landing page.
  type_specific_notes: |
    Image and table counts are report-specific — use the source data to
    determine expected counts. Do not apply hardcoded thresholds.
