name: "Internal Memo"
description: "Functional, direct reports for internal audiences"

content:
  tone: |
    Direct, concise, action-oriented. Write for busy internal stakeholders
    who need the key points fast. Skip preambles. Lead with conclusions.
  structure: |
    Executive summary up front, then supporting details. Bullet lists are
    acceptable for action items and key findings. Keep sections short.
  frontmatter_note: |
    Frontmatter colors describe the source material. The memo itself uses
    minimal styling — no brand colors needed.

design:
  aesthetic: "Clean, functional, no-nonsense — like a well-formatted internal document"
  accent_color: |
    Slate blue or muted gray. Minimal color use. The document should feel
    functional, not designed.
  fonts:
    body: "Serif or clean sans-serif at 11pt"
    headings: "Same family as body, just bolder/larger"
  body_size: "11pt"
  cover: "Title, date, author, distribution list. No decorative elements."
  columns: "Single column only."

qa:
  body_size_range: "10-12pt"
  max_colors: 2
  screenshot_test: |
    Looks like a well-formatted internal document from a professional
    organization. Clean and functional, not flashy.
